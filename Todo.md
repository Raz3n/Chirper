1. Users
    -> Register
    -> Login
    -> Logout
    -> Profile
        -> Image?
        -> Text?
        -> Follow Button?
    -> Feed
        -> User's feed only?
        -> User + who follow?

If not using Django, start with Users. Since this is django, I can start with chirps/tweets.

2. Chirps(Tweets)
    -> Creating
        -> Text
        -> Image
    -> Delete
    -> Rechirping(retweeting)

3. Following / Followers

maybe Todos 
    -> Notifications
    -> DM
    -> Finding hashtags?
